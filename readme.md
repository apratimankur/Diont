## Get started (see example folder for more)
```javascript
var diont = require('../diont.js')();

// ======
// Listen for announcements and renouncements in services
// ======
diont.on("serviceAnnounced", function(serviceInfo) {
	// A service was announced
	// This function triggers for services not yet available in diont.getServiceInfos()
	// serviceInfo is an Object { isOurService : Boolean, service: Object }
	// service.name, service.host and service.port are always filled
	console.log("A new service was announced", serviceInfo.service);
	// List currently known services
	console.log("All known services", diont.getServiceInfos());
});

diont.on("serviceRenounced", function(serviceInfo) {
	console.log("A service was renounced", serviceInfo.service);
	console.log("All known services", diont.getServiceInfos());
});

// ======
// Announce our own service
// ======
var service = {
	name: "TestServer 1",
	host: "127.0.0.1", // when omitted, defaults to the local IP
	port: "1231"
	// any additional information is allowed and will be propagated
};
diont.announceService(service);

// Renounce after 5 seconds
setTimeout(function() {
	diont.renounceService(service);
}, 5000);
